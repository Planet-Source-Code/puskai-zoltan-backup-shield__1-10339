</div>

### Description

You can backup You Files and folders with this program. When You shut down your computer, Backup Shield will ask You, if You want to backup Your files.

It uses a backup.ini file to store the backup directories. please copy My Backup.ini file in the folder, where you put Backup.exe then change the settings (I haven't wrote to make a backup.ini when it does not exists)

The files, and directories which have been backuped are stored in a directory like \Backup\Backup 2000.08.03.
